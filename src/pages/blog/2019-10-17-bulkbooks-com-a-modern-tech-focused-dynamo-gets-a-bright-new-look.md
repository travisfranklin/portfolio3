#### When I set out to re-design BulkBooks.com I was given three objectives:  
1. Give us the ability to directly target certain market segments.  
2. Create a means for BulkBooks.com to adapt quickly to new market opportunities and trends.  
3. Make us more modern than all of our competitors.  

#### Here's the old site:

It's a workhorse, for sure, and arguably already more modern than many of it's competitors, but we knew it could be better.

### Here's the new site:

We made books bold and visible above the fold, and drew attention to them with some basic parallax. Our CTA is pure and bold. Site visitors now know clearly what BulkBooks.com offers, and what to do about it. Search! On top of this, the site is also formatted to be more mobile friendly as we have seen market trends shifting towards more mobile purchases. This is all very exciting, but we haven't even scratched the surface of what we changed.

#### Verticals!

Now when BulkBooks targets a market, they don't just send users to their front page, they send them to a page with catered content, increasing user engagement through relevance. The best part about this is that more verticals can be added easily as marketing efforts expand.

```

#### Custom Articles!

We were tasked with providing a means for BulkBooks.com to rapidly adapt to market trends. This was solved through a battery of pages for articles, lists, and special categories, all designed for crystal clear readability, and SEO.

I'm happy to say that BulkBooks.com has really exploded out of the gate with it's new website design focused on user relevance, throughput, and SEO. You can view the new site (along with the fancy dancy parallax animations) [here](http://www.bulkbooks.com)!
