### The story
I've was given the opportunity to work with a crack team of devs at an agency up in Vancouver, BC building a new application called Kaoshi. The the app was a finalist for the 2019 Africa Prize for Engineering by the Royal Academy of Engineering and looks like it will be a game-changer for folks looking to transfer funds across borders. They had a basic product, but their core user experience wasn't yet designed, and their UI was in a placeholder state. They needed someone to come in and redesign things from the ground up.

#### My role
I was given mocks of a couple pages that helped me get an idea of Kaoshi's brand feel, some very short deadlines, and a request to focus on the desktop experience of the site first and foremost for pitching purposes. That's not generally the way one should design sites, but business needs come first. Did I mention we were on a tight deadline?

#### Planning
It was important to start from the user's perspective. This application wasn't just being used in nations with snappy internet connections and up-to-date hardware. It needs to function well for a user in Nigeria who's access to the internet likely comes via a cell network on their phone. Data rates are expensive (I did that math. Turns out it comes to about 1/6th of the average individual's yearly salary.) So data isn't cheap. The site can't rely on costly videos or images. The UI will need to be as lean as possible.

We were on a rapid timeline for site design, and after a bit of research, I decided it would be worthwhile to use a component framework to be able to quickly bring the site's design up to spec. We went with Vuetify. It's lovely, easy to work with, and most importantly, fast to implement. We can also use its treeshaking to lower build size.

#### Design
Being a fintech application, our UI needed to display a great deal of information without becoming overwhelming. I utilized friendly colors, and lots of white space to help things feel simpler. This alongside Material design components from Vuetify helped site interactions feel friendly and familiar.
