#### Udacity FEND Project 1
This is the first project requested of me at the Udacity Front End Nanodegree. It focused on using layout basics to build a simple portfolio-style site. The site you're currently on has replaced this project's site, but you can still view the project via Github pages [here!](https://travisfranklin.github.io/FEND-Project1/portfolio.html)

#### Required Elements:

- at least 4 images
- title text (h1, h2, etc.)
- regular (paragraph) text
- a logo.
- Semantic HTML
- HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.
- No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a CSS class or id.

#### Custom Design:

- Customize images and text.

- Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with HTML, CSS or both.

- Customize CSS styles applied at minimum to paragraph and heading elements.

- Grid-Based Layout
