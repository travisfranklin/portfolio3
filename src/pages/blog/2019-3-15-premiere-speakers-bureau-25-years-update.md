#### Redesigning PSB's ebsite was no easy task.
The site is used daily and repeatedly by power users and booking agents scouting talent for corporate and organizational events. Every change needs to be thought through from that perspective. I can't completely upset those user's flow by moving many elements around. Instead I focused on a few major points:
1. Mobile useability. (their previous site was barely functional on mobile devices)
2. Search engine optimization (recently keyword competition has intensified in the field of speakers bureaus, and I needed to implement some careful planning to ensure the site remained competitive in a way that's scalable)
3. Optimized user throughput to conversions (after all, that is the point of this website, right?)

#### Here's the highest traffic pages from the old site:

```
It's a good site, but can definitely be improved.

#### Pre-planning
Before any design phase, my first step is always to gather data. I mapped primary user routes through the current site noting pages with substantial drop-off percentages. I then interviewed employees within the company who interface with users daily (sales and CS) to learn what positives and negatives have come down the line directly from our customers. 

I discovered a bit of friction. PSB serves a very broad range of clients with an even broader range of topic speakers, and that can be daunting on one's first visit. They needed to land on a more relevant page to the type of speaker they were looking for, and that the current existing topic pages weren't cutting it both from a useability standpoint, but also from an SEO standpoint. They weren't showing up in search.  

After gathering data, I decided it would be best to draft a flow for user traversal of the site noting paths that would get the fastest throughput to conversion. In that path, I marked areas where highest drop-off rates currently existed so I could better address them in the design phase.

#### The Homepage

For the homepage I enlarged the hero image and encapsulated the search bar in it. This afforded us a more stunning first impression, while also drawing more attention to the primary CTA on the page. The search bar (arguably the most used aspect of the page) is now larger and more centrally located for easier use. For the sake of SEO, I also focused on bringing more speaker profile information onto the front page through the use of improved speaker cards. This idea was continued with a much improved topics section on the page. All of this was followed by a value statement section featuring a carousel of glowing endorsements, and a listing of some of the company's most recognizeable clients.

#### The Speaker Profile

Arguably the most important page on the site since it's where a majority of conversions occur. This page suffered from multiple problems: 1) a lack of proper prioritization of content, and 2) A lack of preparation for when specific data in a speaker's profile is lacking. The final result is much more thoughtful and readable layout that even makes room for speaker reviews! I also made some adjustments to the page contents to help with SEO regarding that particular speaker. Now searches for that speaker's name will begin appearing much higher in search results.

#### The Topic Page
![PSB's NEW site, topic page](/img/PSB_topic.jpg)
The severely lacking topic page has been turned into the perfect landing page for event planners. It mirrors the home page almost entirely, but populates it with content that is relevant to a topic. This allows for us to link directly to topic pages when we know an event planner is searching for specific content.

#### The Search Page

The search page has been completely redesigned and is able to show more speakers at once, with more relevant information. I also planned in a feature where users can now curate their own collection of speakers and save them for later review. These saved speakers can also be viewed by our sales agents so they can provide better suggestions to clients in the future. This data will also be helpful in the future for better determining what speaker profiles are most appealing to clients. We can use this data to help us aid speakers in creating more attractive profiles for themselves.

I hope you enjoyed this simplified look at a small part of the work that went into this fantastic site. There are many more pages to the site, and even an entire proprietary back-end system that required design, but that's probably a topic for another day.
