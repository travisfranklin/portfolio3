#### Udacity FEND Project 3
This project focused on using HTML/CSS for styling and vanilla Javascript including classes and IIFEs for controlling the interaction of sprites within the canvas API. You can access the game [here](https://travisfranklin.github.io/FEND-Project3/).

#### How to play
- Undertake a journey to the top of the game board.  
- You can navigate using your arrow keys. 
- Beware, you must pass many scary creatures on your way. Take heed not to touch them, or your precious vitality will be diminished. 
- Touch one of these foul creatures three times and you surely shall perish.
- When you make a successful journey, your score will increase and you'll be transported back to the start to undertake another journey.  
- As your score increases, the creatures will become more difficult to evade.  
- As any wanderer knows, every journey has an end. Yours will end when your vitality reaches zero. The higher your score, the more journeys you experienced. That is your final goal.  

This may sound bleak but take heart—see how far your travels will take you before you reach the road's end.

#### Future Updates
- Add sprite animations to all entities for greater movement  
- Add extra life pickups.  
- Add score boost pickups.  
- Make individual enemy sprites randomize each time they reach the edge of the canvas to portray a better variety of baddies.  
- Add sounds and background music so it feels like a legit game  
- Add some foreground animation (like fog passing over the canvas) for better immersion
